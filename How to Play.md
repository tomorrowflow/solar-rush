### **How to Play**  
**Welcome to the AI-First Hackathon!**  
These rules are here to help us experiment, collaborate, and push boundaries. Let’s make it fun and productive!  

---

### **1. AI-First Principles**  
- **Everything is AI-First**: Use AI tools (e.g., Claude, OpenRouter, MidJourney) for all tasks unless specified otherwise.  
- **No Manual Work**: If AI can do it, use it! (e.g., generate code, docs, or tests with AI.)  
- **Human Oversight**: Always review AI outputs before finalizing.  

---

### **2. Sprint Goals & Rapid Prototyping**  
- **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you’ll build in 12–24 hours.  
- **Build Fast**: Focus on MVPs (Minimum Viable Products), not perfection.  
- **Frequent Check In**: Share progress, blockers, and next steps in 3-minute stand-ups.  

---

### **3. Tools & Accounts**  
- **Use Allowed Tools**: Le Chat, Claude, KiloCode, OpenRouter, MidJourney, and others.  
- **Private Accounts**: Create accounts with personal emails (no company domains).  
- **No Shared Keys**: Avoid sharing API keys. Use a shared key only if approved. For coding an API key will be provided.  

---

### **4. Experimentation & Creativity**  
- **Try Anything**: No idea is too wild! (e.g., “What if we conquer the world with renewable energy?”)  
- **Fail Fast**: Learn from mistakes. Share what didn’t work and pivot.  
- **Cross-Tool Hacks**: Use at least 2 AI tools in your project (e.g., Claude + MidJourney).  

---

### **5. Collaboration & Ethics**  
- **Be Respectful**: Share ideas openly and support each other.  
- **Avoid Harm**: Don’t use AI for biased, unethical, or harmful outputs.  
- **Transparency**: Document how AI tools were used in your project.  

---

### **6. Data & Security**  
- **No Sensitive Data**: Avoid inputting company secrets, personal info, or confidential content.  
- **Anonymize Data**: If using real-world data, remove identifying details first.  

---

### **7. Credit & Budgeting**  
- **Track Spending**: Use the shared dashboard to monitor credit usage.  
- **Respect Limits**: Stay within budget to avoid running out of credits.

### **Final Note**  
These rules are here to guide, not restrict. **Have fun, experiment boldly, and let AI help you create something amazing!**
