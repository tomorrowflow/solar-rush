# Energy Rush: Solar Sprint

Welcome to **Energy Rush: Solar Sprint**! This project is a cooperative game focused on renewable energy management, team coordination, and overcoming environmental challenges. Players work together to gather energy from solar, wind, and hydro sources, manage a shared energy grid, and respond to obstacles like storms and equipment failures.

This game is being developed as part of an **AI-First Hackathon**. The development process emphasizes the use of AI tools for various tasks, from code generation to asset creation, following the guidelines outlined in [`How to Play.md`](How%20to%20Play.md:).

## Game Overview

*   **Core Concept:** A collaborative game where players manage renewable energy resources.
*   **Gameplay:** Involves collecting energy tokens, managing grid capacity, dealing with dynamic obstacles (environmental hazards, system failures, demand spikes), and coordinating team roles (Energy Collectors, Engineers, Dispatchers, Monitors).
*   **Inspiration:** Draws inspiration from games like Eco (sustainability), Factorio (resource management), and Overcooked (cooperative action).

## Development Approach

The development follows an AI-First methodology, leveraging tools for coding, documentation, and potentially asset generation. The project is planned in phases, starting from design finalization and prototyping, moving through technical setup and core feature development, to full feature implementation, testing, and deployment.
